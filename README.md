The **bmc_template** package contains two options:
- double
- bibconfig

The BMC dissertations are required to be double spaced. The **double** option changes the linespacing to double space. Keeping the double space as an option allows the content creator to toggle between single spacing and double spacing to their liking during the editing stages of their dissertation.

The requirements for the bibliography are less stringent but require each bibitem to have a hanging indent and single space with double space between entries.
