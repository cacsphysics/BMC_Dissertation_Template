\chapter{Motivation}
Bryn Mawr College established a standard dissertation style. However, a \LaTeX~ template for the dissertation style was, until now, nonexistent. The need to accommodate the various fields of study and their methods for document creation a \LaTeX~ template was needed.

This manuscript contains information relevant for the current version of the \LaTeX~ template created by Carlos A. Cartagena-Sanchez. Since, \LaTeX~ is a powerful markup language which uses \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX}{macro language} to develop custom manuscripts. The intent is to understand how to modify the template to fit the author's needs.
